# Trash Segmentation | CleanRobotics

Instance Segmentation on a proprietary dataset of trash images provided by [CleanRobotics](https://cleanrobotics.com)

## Idea

Train an instance segmentation model(Mask R-CNN for now) to segment and tag trash images on a custom dataset. Implementation will be in Tensorflow/Keras with the goal of deploying the system on a Google Coral EdgeTPU device.

## Timeline

- 06/05 Minimum Viable Demo on a small subset of the data using Mask R-CNN in Tensorflow, Keras and Python3
