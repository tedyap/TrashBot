===================================

CleanRobotics TrashBot is a smart assisted waste sorrting bin 
that uses AI and Computer Vision to segregate different kinds
of trash. 

This project is my work for the Insight Artificial Intelligence
Fellowship, New York in collaboration with CleanRobotics. The 
idea behind the project is to develop and object detection 
solution for the TrashBot. Find out more
