# Code Review from Ted

## Suggestions & Feedback
1. Since some of the arguments are shared across different files,
it might be a good idea to consolidate them into a single function or
file.

1. Some of the code in `train.py` can be abstracted for more clarification.
1. Add comments in places where it might be hard for a reader to understand.
1. Add a simplified version of your code documention in `README`.

1. Object oriented programming is used, i.e. the code is oriented with clear and modular functions.
1. There are no exposed IP addresses (whether private or public), usernames, passwords, secret keys in the code.
